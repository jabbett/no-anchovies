<p>One of my early remembrances of restaurant life was going to Tijuana in 1925
    or 1926 with my parents, who were wildly excited that they should finally
    lunch at Caesar's restaurant. Tijuana, just south of the Mexican border from
    San Diego, was flourishing then, in the prohibition era. People came down
    from the Los Angeles area in droves to eat in the restaurants; they drank
    forbidden beer and cocktails as they toured the bars of the town; they
    strolled in the flowered patio of Agua Caliente listening to the marimba
    band, and they gambled wickedly at the casino. Word spread about Tijuana and
    the good life, and about Caesar Cardini's restaurant, and about Caesar's
    salad.</p>

<p>My parents, of course, ordered the salad. Caesar himself rolled the big cart
    up to the table, tossed the romaine in a great wooden bowl, and I wish I
    could say I remember his every move, but I don't. The only thing I see again
    clearly is the eggs. I can see him break 2 eggs over that romaine and roll
    them in, the greens going all creamy as the eggs flowed over them. Two eggs
    in a salad? Two one-minute coddled eggs? And garlic-flavored croutons, and
    grated Parmesan cheese? It was a sensation from coast to coast, and there
    were even rumblings of its success in Europe.</p>

<p>How could a mere salad cause such emotion? But, one remembers, that was way
    back in 1924, when Caesar Cardini invented it, and it was only in the early
    twenties that refrigerated transcontinental transportation came into being.
    Before then, when produce was out of season in the rest of the country,
    there was no greenery to be had. Before then, too, salads were considered
    rather exotic, definitely foreign, probably Bolshevist, and, anyway, food
    only for sissies.</p>

<p>Almost 50 years later, when we decided upon Caesar Salad as one of the events
    for our program "Kids Want to Cook," I had, as usual, studied all the
    sources and found, as usual, there was no agreement among any of them. I
    evolved what most appealed to me but it lacked a certain authenticity, and
    it had no drama. Then my producer, Ruthie, suggested we try to locate
    someone from that era who knew Caesar and really knew that salad. Was there
    anyone? Indeed there was, Ruthie found. Rosa Cardini, his daughter, was
    living in the Los Angeles area, and was the head of a successful spice and
    salad dressing business. I had a long Boston-to-Los-Angeles telephone
    conversation with her, taking copious notes. She was born five years after
    her father created his masterpiece, she said, but she knew every detail
    because it had been so much discussed and remembered.</p>

<p>As we went over each move, the salad began to take on life for me. At first,
    she said, Caesar used only the tender inside leaves, the hearts, of romain,
    and he served them whole, arranging each portion on a large chilled dinner
    plate, leaf by leaf; you picked up a leaf by its stem end, and you ate it in
    your fingers, leaf by leaf. What a great idea! What fun for television. But,
    she went on, since most Americans do not luck plucking up sauced items with
    their fingers&mdash;witness the reaction to lobster &agrave; l'am&eacute;ricaine served in the
    shell&mdash;he later changed to bite-sized pieces. Was there anything special in
    the way he manipulated the salad? Yes, he had a uniquely Caesar way of
    tossing the salad. In fact, he didn't toss it, he scooped under the leaves
    to make them turn like a large wave breaking toward him, to prevent those
    tender shoots of green from bruising. Again, drama, and a new twist for our
    show. How about anchovies, mustard, herbs, and so forth? <strong>No! No anchovies!</strong>
    Caesar never used anything but the best oil, fresh lemons, salt and pepper,
    a little Worcestershire&mdash;that's where those anchovies crept into so many of
    the recipes I had seen: Worcestershire does have a speck of anchovy. Caesar
    also insisted on the best and freshest Parmesan, and homemade croutons
    basted with oil in which fresh garlic had been steeped.</p>

<p>That is the way we did the salad on our television program, and I have always
    been delighted with it. It is a very simple salad, really, and its beauty
    rests entirely in the excellence of its ingredients&mdash;the best and freshest of
    everything, from romaine, to oil, eggs, lemons, croutons, garlic and
    cheese.</p>

    <h2>Hearts of romaine lettuce with oil and lemon, coddled eggs, Parmesan
        cheese, and garlic croutons</h2>

    <p class="p-author">Caesar Cardini</p>

    <p class="p-summary">Serve this as a first course, or it could be a
        main-course luncheon or supper dish followed by or preceded by a terrine
        or pat&eacute; and sliced fresh tomatoes. On our television show I didn't have
        any time to do the croutons Caesar's way, and you may want to follow
        Rosa's directions for them: cut homemade type unsweetened white bread
        into half-inch dice and dry out in the oven, basting them as they brown
        with olive oil in which you have steeped fresh crushed garlic for
        several days. Except for the croutons, the following recipe duplicates
        Rosa Cardini's instructions for her father's salad, as she repeated them
        to me.</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="p-ingredient">2 large crisp heads romaine lettuce</li>
        <li class="p-ingredient">2 large cloves garlic and a garlic press</li>
        <li class="p-ingredient">Salt</li>
        <li class="p-ingredient">&#190; cup best-quality olive oil</li>
        <li class="p-ingredient">2 cups best-quality plain unseasoned toasted
            croutons
        </li>
        <li class="p-ingredient">1 lemon</li>
        <li class="p-ingredient">2 eggs</li>
        <li class="p-ingredient">&#188; cup (1 ounce) genuine imported real
            Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
        </li>
        <li class="p-ingredient">Peppercorns in a grinder</li>
        <li class="p-ingredient">Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="e-instructions">
        <p><strong>The romaine.</strong> You want 6 to 8 whole unblemished
            leaves of romaine, between 3 and 7 inches long, per person. Strip
            the leaves carefully from the stalks, refrigerate rejects in a
            plastic bag and reserved for another salad. Wash your Caesar leaves
            gently, to keep them from breaking, shake dry, and roll loosely in
            clean towels. Refrigerate until serving time.</p>

        <p><strong>The croutons.</strong> Pur&eacute;e the garlic into a small heavy
            bowl, and mash to a smooth paste with a pestle or spoon, adding
            &#188; teaspoon salt and dribbling in 3 tablespoons of the oil.
            Strain into a medium-sized frying pan and heat to just warm, add the
            croutons, toss for about a minute over moderate heat, and turn into
            a nice serving bowl.</p>

        <p><strong>Other preliminiaries.</strong> Shortly before serving,
            squeeze the lemon into a pitcher, boil the eggs exactly 1 minute,
            grate the cheese into another nice little bowl, and arrange all of
            these on a tray along with the rest of the olive oil, the croutons,
            pepper grinder, salt, and Worcestershire. Have large dinner plates
            chilled, arrange the romaine in the largest salad bowl you can find,
            and you are ready to go.</p>

        <p><strong>Mixing the salad.</strong> Prepare to use large rather slow
            and dramatic gestures for everything you do, as though you were
            Caesar himself. First pour 4 tablespoons of oil over the romaine and
            give the leaves 2 rolling tosses&mdash;hold salad fork in one hand, spoon
            in the other, and scoop under the leaves at each side of the bowl,
            bringing the implements around the edge to meet each other opposite
            you, then scoop them up toward you in a slow roll, bringing the
            salad leaves over upon themselves like a large wave breaking toward
            you; this is to prevent them from bruising as you season them.
            Sprinkle on &#188; teaspoon of salt, 8 grinds of pepper, 2 more spoonfuls
            of oil, and give another toss. Pour on the lemon juice, 6 drops of
            Worcestershire, and break in the eggs. Toss twice, sprinkle on the
            cheese. Toss once, then sprinkle on the croutons and give two final
            tosses.</p>

        <p><strong>Serving.</strong> Arrange the salad rapidly but stylishly
            leaf by leaf on each large plate, stems facing outward, and a
            sprinkling of croutons at the side. Guests may eat the salad with
            their fingers, in the approved and original Caesar manner, or may
            use knives and forks&mdash;which they will need anyway for the croutons.
